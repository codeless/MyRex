# Description

Please see myrex.sh and the accompanied example for a detailed description.


# Resources

  - [Shell programming](http://www.shelldorado.com/)


# Ideas for improvement

  - HTML-Mails, since MySQL can output the resulting rows as HTML-Table (see --html option)
  - Different return values on error, see [Advanced Bash Scripting Guide](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html)
